- [ ] Pull from single folder in (e.g.) Dropbox with ALL RAW DATA
	- Have necessary file/s in Cloud with timestamp.
	- Clean up `data-input`
- [ ] ADD Checkpoints in code 
	- What if happens if one file fails?
	- Using `work-data` files if exist?
	- Parallelize where possible (run background Do-files?)
- [ ] Problem with create-flag-variables.do reshape.
