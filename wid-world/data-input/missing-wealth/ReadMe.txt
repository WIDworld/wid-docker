All the computations made for my articles “Taxing Across Borders: Tracking Personal Wealth and Corporate Profits” can be found in the Excel file Zucman2014JEPdata.xlsx

This file includes the raw data sources used in this research (NIPA data, balance of payments, Swiss National Bank statistics, etc.), and details all the computations made from these raw data. It also includes a number of methodological notes.

This Excel file is supplemented by an Online Appendix pdf file Zucman2014JEPAppendix.pdf that further discusses some of the computations and provides a number of supplementary results.
