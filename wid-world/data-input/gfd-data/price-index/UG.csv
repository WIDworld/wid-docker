CPUGAM,Uganda Consumer Price Index,Consumer Price Indices,Uganda Shilling,Uganda,Index Number,Units,Stock,none,Monthly From Apr 1981 To Apr 2016<BR>,"Source: Bank of Uganda. <br />Notes: The consumer price index (CPI) is defined in Uganda as a measure of the cost of all goods and services purchased by Uganda households and its purposes are to (1) measure inflation; (2) deflate key economic indicators; and (3) to some extent to be used to adjust incomes. The CPI is a measure of changes in prices that consumers must pay for a fixed basket of goods and services. The CPI is intended to cover all private households in Uganda, but the geographic coverage is limited to 6 main urban centres-Kampala/Entebbe, Jinja, Mbale, Masaka, Mbarara and Gulu. Goods and services are classified in 7 main groups with weights food (45.2%); beverages and tobacco (8.6%); clothing and footwear (5.5%); rent, fuel, and utilities (14.1%); household and personal goods (5.3%); transport and communications (6.7%); and Health, Education & Entertainment (14.6%). The main groups are sub-divided into 24 subgroups and the basket includes 121 items. The weights in use are based on the Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS) 1997 conducted between March, 1997 to November 1997 and the base is prices of 12 months (July 1997-June 1998). Prices for electricity charges are collected on revision of the charge by UEDCL. Education charges are collected three times a year in January, May and September. Rent of rented houses is collected on a quarterly basis in the months of January, April, July and October. Prices for fruit and vegetables are collected twice a month, in the first week of the month and the week containing the 15th of the month. Prices for the rest of the items are collected once a month. Approximately 2000price observations are collected each month. In compiling the index, an average price for an item in a given urban centre is compared with an average price for the previous month. A modified Laspeyres formula is used to calculate the index. A composite index for all urban areas is compiled, and data are disseminated for the composite broken down by major categories and for each urban centre also broken down by major categories.",
