CPSGPM,Singapore Consumer Price Index,Consumer Price Indices,Singapore Dollar,Singapore,Index Number,Units,Stock,none,Monthly From Jan 1948 To Apr 2016<BR>,"Sources: Department of Statistics, Monthly Digest of Statistics (1948-) Notes: For data prior to 1962, the Malaysian CPI is used since it was calculated in Singapore. Data are disseminated on the CPI (November 1997 - October 1998 =100) which is compiled using a fixed-weight Laspeyres formula.  The index covers 741 items, divided into 7 groups and 138 sections. 33,400 price quotations are collected each month from 2,410 outlets. For perishable food items at wet markets, prices are collected three times a week. Price data on most other items are monitored monthly, usually on the 15th, while those on rentals are obtained on a quarterly basis. The prices are the normal retail prices paid by consumers, including taxes. The weights for the current index series are derived from the results of the Household Expenditure Survey conducted between November 1997 and October 1998. The records of 5,487 households, which comprised the central 90 per cent in the distribution of households by household expenditure, were used to derive the weighting pattern. The weighting pattern and basket of goods and services are revised once every five years to reflect changes in the consumption expenditure pattern of Singaporean households. The CPI is re-based every five years. Seasonally-adjusted indices are published at the group level.",
