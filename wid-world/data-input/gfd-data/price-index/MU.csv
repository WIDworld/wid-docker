CPMUSM,Mauritius Consumer Price Index,Consumer Price Indices,Mauritius Rupee,Mauritius,Index Number,Units,Stock,none,Annual From Dec 1946 To Dec 1948<BR>Monthly From Jan 1949 To May 2016<BR>,"Sources: Digest of Colonial Statistics (1946-1962), Central Statistical Office, Digest of Statistics (1962-) Notes: Data are annual from 1946 through 1949, semi-annual in 1950, quarterly in 1951 and monthly thereafter. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the change in the level of prices of goods and services that the private consumer buys. It is made up of a basket of goods and services which not only covers commodities of basic necessity, but includes all those forming part of private consumption expenditure. The composition of this basket reflects the general consumption pattern of all types of private households of the Republic of Mauritius. The computation of the CPI follows the ILO standards.  The composition of the CPI basket used for computing the CPI for the months of July 1997 to June 2002 has been derived from data obtained in a Household Budget Survey (HBS) conducted over the twelve-month period July 1996 - June 1997. The HBS involved 6234 households out of a total number of households of around 250,000. The weight of certain items, in particular expenditures on alcoholic beverages and tobacco, was adjusted for underreporting using information from additional sources. Excluded from the CPI are financial services, services of owner-occupied dwellings, and a few minor types of expenditures. The basket is classified at four levels with nine major commodity groups, 37 groups, 100 subgroups and 251 item classes.",
