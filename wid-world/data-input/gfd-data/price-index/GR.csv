Delivanis and W. C. Cleveland, Greek Monetary Developments, Bloomington: Univ. Of Indiana Press (1939-1946); National Statistical Service, Monthly Statistical Bulletin (1946-) Notes: The data are rebased beginning in 1946 to reflect the end of the inter-war hyperinflation. Data are disseminated on the CPI, a Laspeyres-type index (1999=100), which covers the entire country of Greece. The Greek CPI is a fixed base index, revised at approximately 6-year intervals. The weights of the items (good and services), which are used for the compilation of the revised CPI, were calculated on the basis of the results of the Household Budget Survey conducted in the period October1998 - November 1999. In the frame of the last revision of the Index, its geographic coverage was extended from the urban areas to the whole country.   The Population coverage is the same as that of the previous CPIs. More precisely, the index covers, as regards the weights, private households only, leaving out collective households and foreign visitors (tourists) in Greece.   Prices are collected from outlets located in 25 cities of Greece, whose markets are considered as representative centers of wider geographic areas. Depending on the items, the outlets are distinguished as department stores, specialized stores, supermarkets, open-air markets and enterprises rendering services. The frequency of price collection varies depending on the nature of the products. Prices of fresh products (fruit and vegetables and fish) and energy products (heating oil, petrol) are collected once a week. For the other products, prices are collected once a month. Weekly prices refer to Tuesday. Monthly prices are collected in a cyclical manner so as to refer to the whole month. The collected prices correspond with the prices actually paid by the consumer and consequently all taxes (included VAT) are included.  The basket covered by the index comprises 725 products from 12 product categories. Monthly price quotations number approximately 50,000 and are collected from 4,500 outlets and 1,500 households. Prices are not seasonally adjusted.",,Split adjusted.
