The Kenya CPI launched in April 2002 is based on the 1993/94 Urban Household Budget Survey (UHBS) with October 1997 as base period. Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) collects, compiles, and disseminates the Kenya Consumer Price Indices (CPI). Retail price information is collected from 13 representative urban centers across Kenya. The information is collected from different market outlets. The indices are designed to measure changes in the general level of retail prices of goods and services consumed by Kenyan urban households. CPI data mainly involves the collection of price data by visiting the retail outlets. Prices of primary agricultural food stuffs  are collected from open markets. These items are weighed to determine their unit price. Prices of each of the rest of the items are collected from 3 different retail outlets in each of the 25 zones countrywide. In total there are 206 commodities in the  CPI basket. Nairobi's lower income has 185 items, Nairobi middle upper, 210 items while rest of urban towns have 216 items. Overall, over 11,000 quotations are used in the compilation of Kenya's CPI. However, prices of some consumer items like electricity tariffs and post & telecommunication services are centrally collected from the respective national service providers. Prices are verified both by the field and headquarter staff.  Completed price questionnaires are returned to the CPI unit at headquarters for the computation of price indices. The indices are calculated from item index to group index according to the modified Laspeyres formula. The Kenya CPI launched in April 2002 is based on the 1993/94 Urban Household Budget Survey (UHBS) with October 1997 as base period.",
