CPTZAM,Tanzania Consumer Price Index,Consumer Price Indices,Tanzania Shilling,"Tanzania, United Republic Of",Index Number,Units,Stock,none,Annual From Dec 1947 To Jun 1950<BR>Monthly From Jul 1950 To Apr 2016<BR>,"Sources: Bank of Tanzania, Economic Bulletin Notes: The National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) measures the changing cost of a fixed basket of goods and services purchased by the private consumer and is the official measure of inflation in the country. The NCPI covers 20 urban towns of mainland Tanzania and represents households of all income groups. The reference period is December 1994. Sub indices for minimum, middle, and high income groups for the mainland and for Dar-es-Salaam are also being compiled.  The NCPI basket of goods and services is derived from the 1991/92 Household Budget Survey (HBS) and contains 212 consumer items, 84 of which are food and 128 nonfood items. The index does not incorporate the imputed rents of owner-occupied dwellings, but actual rents are included. Prices are collected by personal visits of regional office staff. Market prices consisting of mainly food items are collected from central markets by actual purchases for three consecutive days during the first or second week of the month. For nonfood items pricing quotes are collected from five different outlets. The purchased items are weighted at the office to determine the unit price. Prices of other consumer items, including items like tariffs and postage stamps, are collected from their respective selling outlets. Price quotes are verified both by the regional and the central NBS offices. In addition, central office staff make frequent inspection visits.  The regional offices send the price forms to the NBS for the computation of the index. The lowest level indices are determined as simple averages of the price relatives of the basic observations. These indices are aggregated into group and overall indices according to the modified Laspeyres formula.  The representative items and varieties have been selected on a judgmental basis. Originally, the items were narrowly specified, but in actual practice frequent substitution takes place without calculation of possible quality differences. No specific outlets have been selected, although for practical reasons often prices are collected from the same outlets. However, regional offices have now been directed to select five permanent outlets.  If a seasonal item is not available in one region, its price is imputed by the price movements of that item in other regions. If exceptionally a seasonal item is not available in any region, its price is carried forward until it reappears on the market. Replacement items are used for items that have temporarily disappeared from the market. If no replacement item can be found, the weight of the permanently disappeared item is distributed over remaining items. New products are exclusively introduced when a new basket is selected, which is normally every ten years.
