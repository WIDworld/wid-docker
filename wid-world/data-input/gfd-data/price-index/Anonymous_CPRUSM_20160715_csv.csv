No data are available from March 1924 to 1926, from 1941 to 1944 and from 1973 to 1991. Data are annual from 1927 to 1972. The Soviet government calculated the data from 1916 to 1924. The data from 1929 to 1955 is based upon the Retail Price Index for State and Cooperative Stores calculated by Garvy, and the data from 1955 to 1972 is a retail price index based upon the turnover tax as calculated by Howard. The current data are calculated based upon monthly changes in consumer prices.  <br />  <br />Data are disseminated on the consumer price index, a modified Laspeyres index (1995 = 100), covering all regions of the Russian Federation. The overall index is published, as well as indices for the following three subgroups: foodstuffs, non-food products, and services.  <br />  <br />The index includes all major groups of goods and services, covering 500,000 number of prices and tariffs collected from 50,000 commercial organizations. On the 23-25th of each month, prices for 445 goods and services are surveyed in 266 cities from all regions of the Russian Federation. The consumer price includes the value added tax (VAT), excise tax, sales tax, and other indirect taxes.  <br />  <br />Data on consumer spending by the population, derived from household budget surveys, are used as weights in the compilation of the CPI. Additional information is also used to determine the specific weight of individual items in the consumer basket: data on the structure of the retail trade turnover, on the output of certain types of products, other sources, and judgments. The weights are derived from the annual household budget surveys of the preceding year and are chain-linked. Weight revisions are introduced in January of each year. There is no fixed schedule for rebasing the index. Data are not seasonally adjusted.",
