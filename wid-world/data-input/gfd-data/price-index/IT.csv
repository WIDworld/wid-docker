R. Mitchell, European Historical Statistics, 1750-1975, New York: Facts on File, 1980 (1861-1919), League of Nations (1920-1945); Central Institute of Statistics, Monthly Bulletin (1946-) Notes: Annual data were used for 1861 through 1919 and from August 1939 through 1943. The Italian consumer price index, (Indice nazionale dei prezzi al consumo per l'intera collettivitÃ  NIC) is an annually chained Laspeyres type index (reference base period 1995=100) covering the whole national territory. From January 1999, Istat adopted a chain Laspeyres index, re-based yearly, with a price reference period in December of previous year.  Prices are collected monthly with the exception of durables, semi durables and rents (quarterly) and seasonal goods (twice a month). The prices of the reference month are collected from the 16th day of the previous month up to the 15th day of the current month. The price quotations refer to a group of approximately 1,031 products classified accordingly to the COICOP'95 Rev.1 classification. The CPI is based on approximately 332,000 price quotations each month taken at 33,000 sales outlets and 11,000 households.  The weights are represented by the values of final household consumption as derived from the National Accounts. These values are then corrected on the basis of other information derived from the Household Budget Survey and from other sources.  Price changes are also measured monthly by the FOI (CPI for white and blue collars workers) and the HICP index (Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices) with the same methodology. The FOI index (without tobacco) is widely used for indexing purposes in Italian laws and regulations. The HICP index is computed for European purposes. Data are not seasonally adjusted.",
