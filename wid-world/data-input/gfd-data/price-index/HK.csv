CPHKGM,Hong Kong Consumer Price Index,Consumer Price Indices,Hong Kong Dollar,Hong Kong,Index Number,Units,Stock,none,Quarterly From Mar 1947 To Dec 1950<BR>Monthly From Jan 1951 To Apr 2016<BR>,"Sources: Hong Kong Statistical Bureau, Monthly Bulletin of Statistics (1947-) Notes: Data are quarterly from 1947 to 1950 and monthly thereafter. Data are disseminated for four different CPIs, namely, Consumer Price Index (A) [CPI(A)], Consumer Price Index (B) [CPI(B)], Consumer Price Index (C) [CPI(C)] and Composite CPI. (1) The CPI(A) is based on the expenditure patterns of about 50 percent of households, in the relatively low expenditure range, in Hong Kong, which had an average monthly expenditure of $4,500-$18,499 in 1999/2000 (October 1999 - September 2000). (2) The CPI(B) is based on the expenditure patterns of the next 30 percent of households, which had an average monthly expenditure of $18,500-$32,499 in 1999/2000. (3) The CPI(C) is based on the expenditure patterns of the next 10 percent of households, which had an average monthly expenditure of $32,500-$65,999 in 1999/2000.  (4) The Composite CPI, which is the main indicator of consumer price inflation in Hong Kong, is based on the expenditure patterns of all the above households taken together. The CPIs are Laspeyres indices, with a base period of the 12-month period from October 1999 to September 2000. The CPIs cover 984 items. About 45,000 price quotations from some 4,000 outlets, including retail outlets and service providers, are obtained monthly. Prices do not include general sales tax as it does not exist in Hong Kong, but do include duties imposed on a very confined list of items such as motor spirits, tobacco, and drinks containing methyl alcohol. Prices are collected twice a week, monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, and annually for different items. The weights are derived from the Household Expenditure Survey, and the indices are re-based and the weights revised every five years. Seasonally adjusted CPIs are also available.",
