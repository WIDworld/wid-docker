Zimbabwe abandoned its own currency after an episode of hyperinflation. It now uses
a number of foreign currencies, including the US dollar, in which official statistics
are now reported. This is also true of old GDP estimates, that have been converted
into USD at the market exchange rate.

Some data in the original WID, however, are still in Zimbabwean dollars. For consistency,
we convert them in USD at the same market exchange rate than the UN after 1970
(introduction of the Zimbabwean dollar). To do that, we need to know the exchange rate
in question, which quite hard to find. I retrieved old UN SNA tables from the internet
archive (archive.org) that were still in Zimbabwean dollar, and calculated the exchange
rate by comparing them with the current tables in USD.
